# Room Occupancy Prediction: An Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the Room Occupancy Prediction project! This project aims to predict the number of people in a room using sensor data from Meraki devices. By leveraging real-time data and machine learning techniques, we can create a system that provides valuable insights into room occupancy patterns.

## Technologies Used
This project combines several cutting-edge technologies to achieve its goals:

1. **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other in real-time. In this project, we use MQTT to collect sensor data from Meraki devices, such as chassis fan speed, temperature, and humidity.

2. **Meraki Sensors:** Meraki is a company that provides a range of networking and security products, including sensors. These sensors can measure various environmental factors and provide real-time data streams. We utilize Meraki sensors to gather the necessary data for our room occupancy prediction model.

3. **TimescaleDB:** TimescaleDB is a time-series database that is optimized for storing and querying large amounts of time-stamped data. We use TimescaleDB to store the sensor data collected via MQTT, enabling efficient data retrieval and aggregation for analysis and model training.

4. **Python:** Python is a versatile programming language widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development. In this project, we use Python to process and analyze the sensor data, build and train machine learning models, and create the necessary scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and inference.

5. **scikit-learn:** scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We leverage scikit-learn to build and train our room occupancy prediction model.

6. **Docker:** Docker is a platform that allows us to package our application and its dependencies into containers. By using Docker, we can ensure that our project runs consistently across different environments, making it easier to deploy and scale.

## Skills and Capabilities
By working on this project, you will gain valuable skills and knowledge in several areas:

1. **Internet of Things (IoT):** You will learn how to collect and process data from IoT devices, such as sensors, using protocols like MQTT. This skill is applicable to a wide range of IoT projects, including smart home automation, industrial monitoring, and more.

2. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** You will develop skills in data analysis and preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature engineering. These skills are essential for any data-related project, as they help in preparing the data for machine learning tasks.

3. **Machine Learning:** You will gain hands-on experience in building and training machine learning models using Python and scikit-learn. You will learn about different algorithms, evaluation metrics, and techniques for improving model performance. These skills are highly sought after in various domains, such as predictive analytics, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.

4. **Real-time Data Processing:** You will learn how to process and analyze data in real-time using MQTT and TimescaleDB. Real-time data processing is crucial for applications that require immediate insights and actions, such as monitoring systems, fraud detection, and real-time personalization.

5. **Containerization and Deployment:** You will gain experience in containerizing applications using Docker. Containerization skills are valuable for deploying and scaling applications in cloud environments, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.

By combining these technologies and skills, you will be well-equipped to tackle a wide range of data-driven projects across different domains. Whether you're interested in IoT, data analysis, machine learning, or real-time systems, this project provides a solid foundation for further exploration and growth.
