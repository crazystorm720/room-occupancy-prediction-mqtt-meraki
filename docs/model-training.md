# Machine Learning Model Training Workflow for Meraki MQTT Sensor Data Using Gradient Boosting

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Collect Data**: Gather Meraki MQTT sensor data from relevant sensors such as temperature, humidity, door open/close status, etc.
- **Store Data**: Save the raw MQTT data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database) for further processing.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing or invalid sensor readings.
  - Convert timestamps to a standardized format.
  - Normalize or scale the sensor values if necessary.
- **Data Exploration**: Examine the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies specific to Meraki sensors.

## 2. Problem Definition and Feature Engineering
- **Define Problem**: Specify the task to be addressed using the Meraki MQTT sensor data (e.g., predicting room occupancy, detecting equipment failures, optimizing energy consumption).
- **Identify Features and Targets**:
  - Select relevant features and target variables based on Meraki sensor capabilities and the problem at hand.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create time-based features, such as hour of the day, day of the week, or season.
  - Aggregate sensor readings over specific time intervals (e.g., hourly averages, daily maximums).
  - Combine multiple sensor readings to create derived features (e.g., temperature-humidity index).

## 3. Data Splitting and Model Selection
- **Data Splitting**:
  - Split the preprocessed Meraki MQTT sensor data into training, validation, and test sets, considering the temporal nature of the data.
- **Model Selection**:
  - Choose gradient boosting as the primary machine learning method.
  - For predicting continuous values (e.g., temperature), use gradient boosting regressor.
  - For classification tasks (e.g., room occupancy), use gradient boosting classifier.
  - For time series forecasting, consider combining gradient boosting with time series techniques if needed.

## 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Train Models**:
  - Use libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM for implementing gradient boosting models.
  - Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluate Models**:
  - Use appropriate evaluation metrics based on the problem type, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression or Accuracy and F1-score for classification.
  - Perform cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization ability.
- **Fine-tune Models**:
  - Adjust hyperparameters based on validation results and repeat the training process if necessary.

## 5. Model Testing and Deployment
- **Assess Performance**:
  - Evaluate the final performance of the trained models using the test set, representing unseen Meraki MQTT sensor data.
  - Use the same metrics as in the validation phase to ensure consistent performance.
- **Select and Deploy Model**:
  - Choose the best-performing model based on test results and prepare it for deployment.
  - Integrate the trained model into a production-ready system that can process real-time Meraki MQTT sensor data and generate predictions or actionable insights.

## 6. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
- **Monitor Performance**:
  - Track the deployed model's performance using live Meraki MQTT sensor data.
  - Collect feedback and analyze the model's predictions and their impact on the defined problem.
- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Gather new Meraki sensor data and use it to retrain and update the model periodically.
  - Adapt the model to handle any changes in the Meraki sensor environment or data patterns.
  - Iterate on the model training workflow based on insights gained and evolving requirements.
